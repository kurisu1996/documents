# Welcome

Loopring is a project for decentralized ERC20 token exchange. The first public blockchain Loopring supports will be Ethereum, but other blockchains with smart contract capability can also be supported in a similar way, such as NEO, Qtum, and EOS. To have an overview of Loopring, please visit our website - [https://loopring.org](https://loopring.org).

Loopring is not a decentralized exchange per se, as all building blocks of a traditional exchange are dissembled and put together again as different roles in a decentralized environment. These roles include, but may not be limited to, wallets, relays, orderbook browsers, ring-miners, and asset tokenization services. Some of those roles are described in [Overview](projects/protocol.md).

This website consists of documents regarding many aspect of Loopring project and its sub-projects. This documentation sub-project is a on-going effort, we need and welcome contributions from the community. If you want to offer help, please join us on [Slack](https://loopring.now.sh/) and read the [How to contribute](contribution.md#) section; if you ever offered any help, please feel free to add your name to the [Contributors](contribution.md) section, it's our honor to have you there.
