Additionally, several institute addresses collectively hold about 118,626,980 LRC that are not suppose to circulate within a year. We cannot list these addresses.

We also have two incentive plan addresses. The first one is the mid-term plan whose LRC may be unlock in about a year; the second address is for the long-term plan whose LRC won't be unlocked until 18 months later.
