## Circulating Supply

After our refunding effort to our early investors in China, our LRC airdrops, and the founding of the Loopring Ecosystem Advancement Fund (LEAF), the total circulating supply is about 585931942 (42%).

The foundation controls the following addresses:

The following addresses contain LRC that are burned by either the foundation or some users (Nobody can transfer these LRC out to another address).

| Address  | LRC Balance
| ------------- | -------------:|
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (blackhole)	|	20,000,000	|
0xEF68e7C694F40c8202821eDF525dE3782458639f (LRC-contract)	|	117,776	|
SUB-TOTAL	|	20,117,776	|	

Additionally, several institute addresses collectively hold about 118,626,980 LRC that are not suppose to circulate within a year but this is not enforced by any contracts. We cannot list these addresses.

We also have two incentive plan addresses. The first one is the mid-term plan whose LRC may be unlock in about a year; the second address is for the long-term plan whose LRC won't be unlocked until 18 months later.

| Address  | LRC Balance
| ------------- | -------------:|
0x8b34fbc553db3462ad4909f2e5577cc22f63c216 (mid-term)	|	39,261,025	|
0x239dE3a0D6ca5f21601f83327eA2174225eB7156 (long-term)	|	92,237,125	|
 SUB-TOTAL	|	131,498,150	|

To Build an ecosystem around the Loopring Protocol, we are also releaseing LRC to a fund called LEAF (more information will be available) to incentivize individual and institute developers for building Loopring-enabled apps and to help us build a better comminity during the next 4 years. We consider this part of LRC is also in circulation.
 
Put all these together, we have:

Address Group  | LRC Balance | Percentage|
------------- | -------------:|-------------:|
Foundation (excluding LEAF)	|	539894433	|	38.7%
Burned	|	20,117,776	|	1.4%
Institute Investors	|	118,626,980	|	8.5%
Incentive Plans|	131,498,150	|	9.4%
Circulating	Supply (including LEAF)|	585931942	|	42%
**Total Supply**	|	<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xEF68e7C694F40c8202821eDF525dE3782458639f">1,395,076,054.5238</a>	|	**100.0%**
